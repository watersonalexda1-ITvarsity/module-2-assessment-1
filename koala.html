                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>The Koala or, inaccurately, koala bear(Phascolartos cinereus), is an arboreal
     herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative 
     of the family Phoscolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats,
     which are members of the familt Vombatidae. The koala is foujnd in coastal areas 
     of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, Nwe South
     Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is is easily recognisable by its stout, 
     tailess body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.
    </p>
    <p>The Koala has a body length of 60-85 cm(24-33 in) and weighs 4-15 kg(9-33 lb).
     Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. koalas from the northern 
     populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts.
     These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed. </p>
   <p>Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees 
     make upmost of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and
     caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas outside the reception area right next to the flower garden.</p>
