                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx(Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the 
        genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari
        Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies. They
        are light brownish grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear
       of the rump. Their tails are long and black in colour. A blackish stripe extends from
       the chin down the loweer edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and 
       leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg.
    </p>
     <p>Gemsbok are the largest species in the species in the genus oryx. They stand about
      1.2 m at the shoulder. The body length can vary from 190cm to 240 cm and the tail 
      measures 45 to 90cm. Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240kg while females weigh 100-210kg
     </p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at the south end of the zoo, after you go past the panda enclosure.</p>
