                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family suidae, commonly known as WARTHOGS
      (pronounced wart-hog). It is the sole genus of subfamily Phacochoerinae.
      They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite and
       regions, sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formely considered 
       conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today
       this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best known and most 
       widespread species, the common warthog is Phacochoerus africanus.
    </p>
     <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely
      naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on
      their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The english name refers to
      their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also have 
      very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches in the males, but
      are always smaller in the females. They are largely herbivorous, but 
      occasionally also eat small animals. While both species remain fairly common
       and widespread, and therefore are considered to be of least concernby the
       IUCN.

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs in the middle of the zoo, opposite the bird enclosure
