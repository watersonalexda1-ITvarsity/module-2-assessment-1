                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as the panda bear (or
     simply the panda) is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised
     by its bold black-and-white coat and rotound body. The name "giant panda" is 
     sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighbouring musteloid.
     Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with 
     bamboo shoots and leaves making up more han 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in
     the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the
     forrm of birds, rodents, or carrion. In capacity, they may recieve honey, eggs,
     fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
    </p>
     <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central china, mainly in
       neighbouring shaanxi and gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation and other
       developments, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it
       once lived and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A2007 report 
       showed 239 pandas lived in captivity outside china, living in 18 zoos in 13 
       different countries.
